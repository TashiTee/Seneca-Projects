The reason for using the vector container rather than any other available in the STL.
by default we use vectors because when using containers, vector is the fastest safe container to access information and it is like an
array that can be dynamically resize. since 
vector is a linear sequence that allows rapid random access to its elements
However, vectors have the ability to handle its own destruction once the object goes out of scope

Why there is no need to deallocate the dynamically allocated memory in your own code.
Vectors can deallocate memory as soon as the object goes out of scope

How the range-based for simplifies coding in this case.

Since the current element of the container is accessed via refernece in the range based for loop, we don't need to worry about the index this way 
we don't have to access via index ex product[i]
