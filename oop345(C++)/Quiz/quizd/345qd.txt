1- Explain the difference between move and copy in constructors and assignment operators logic and
their syntax.
// copy
if object a gets copied and you need to use it then we use copy constructor &,
which creates object by initializing it with an object of the same class, which has been created previously. 
ex.
Class-name(Class-name&); // copy-construcotr
Class-name& operator=(Class-name&); // copy-assignment operator


// move
when object a gets copied and object a is not needed, copies the object and (recycles the object data), data 
is "about to be destroyed anyway;" such data is called an rvalue &&. (object must not be const)
ex. 
Class-name(Class-name&&); // move-construcotr
Class-name& operator=(Class-name&&); // move-assignment operator

2 and 3-
If we have a validation logic as follows:
	bool validMark(int value) {
	return value >= 0 && value <= 100;
	}
And we want to be able to pass this logic as an argument to a function, there are two choices to
do so; function pointer and function object.
2- Write the syntax for a function pointer variable that can point to the logic above.
	bool (*fun_ptr)(int) = &validMark;
	
3- Then create the function object equivalent for the logic above and explain each method.
	bool (*fun_ptr)(int) = validMark;


4 – Explain what the promise class template does as a Provider between threads.


A promise object creates or acquires a shared state in which it can store a value. 

The promise class template provides a simple set_value() counterpart to the get() member function of
 the future class template.
