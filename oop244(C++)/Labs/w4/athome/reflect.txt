1)	What is a safe empty state? Could you define a safe empty state that differs from the empty state that you defined?

- The safe empty state is a state for an object where it does not contain values that are user defined . It is used to ensure 
that the object does not contain garbage values upon initialization of the object.
- Aside from that, there is the not empty state when we initialize the object with values using a public member function

2)	Identify the parts of your source code where to minimized code duplication.
- using the default constructor to initialize invalid values to a safe empty safe state

3)	The canTravelWith(...) member function accesses the private data of the object referenced in its parameter.
Explain why C++ allows this access.
- the function acceses the address of the private data not the data itself in the object.

4)	What statement did you add to ensure that the strncpy(...) function exe-cutes correctly?
- Destination[] = ‘\0’, this statement puts a null terminator at the end of the string to make the string is null terminated.

5)	Explain what you have learned in this workshop.
- I learned how to use function overloading to use the same member function name with different number of parameters passed to it.
How to use bool functions to check the validity of the input data. How to use strncpy correrctly.
