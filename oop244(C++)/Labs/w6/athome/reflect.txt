1). Explain why the copy assignment operator checks for self-assignment before doing anything else.
Because the copy assignment operator deletes the data from the current object, which, if object A = A, will delete the data from the object we copying from.

2). Explain why a class that uses dynamic memory to hold its resources needs custom definitions of its copy constructor and its copy assignment operator.
If we do not declare a copy constructor, the compiler inserts code that implements a shallow copy.  If we do not declare a copy assignment operator, the compiler 
inserts code that implements a shallow assignment. 

3). How did you avoid duplication of code?
Creating new functions, which perform one particular task.

4). List what you have learned in completing this workshop
To create a class that uses dynamic memory, to define a copy contructor which makes a deep copy of an object, to overload operators. 

Quiz 4&5 Reflection

5. certain class desgin require prohibiting client code from copying or copy assisinging any instance of class. What can be done to prohibit from
copying and/copy assinging
= delete
6. Assigning a temporary object to the current object requires additional code if the object manages resource. What can be done to prevent 
the assigment operator from releasing not as yet acquired resource?
we initialize each resource instance variable to an empty value (nullptr).
