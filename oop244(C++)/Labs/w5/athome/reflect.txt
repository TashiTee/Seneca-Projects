1. The operator+ returns a Fraction object. Explain why this operator should not return a reference to a Fraction object. 

Because the reference to the current Fraction object is a constant value and cannot be modified so we can’t store the results in a reference to that object and then return it.

2. List the temporary objects in the tester module. 

a, b(1, 3), c(-5, 15), d(2, 4), e(8, 4)

3. List the simplifications that you made to your class to minimize duplication. 

Fraction(); //used default constructor many times to set an object to a self empty state
isEmpty(); // used this function many times to check if the object is in a safe empty state or not
used the “==” operator function to write the “!=” operator function
used the “+” operator function to write the “+=” operator function

4. Explain what you have learned in this workshop. 

Write different types of operator functions with pass by reference or pass by 	copy method. 
Code my implementation in such a way as to minimize the duplication of source 	code. For example, using previous function to complete new functions.

QUIZ 4 REFLECTION (5/7)

4. What is a free helper function
 -is a function that obtains all of its information from the public member functions of the class that it supports.
 - does not require access to the private members of its class.

5. What is meant by class bloat
- As we add data members, the class definition grows with new queries, this growth is called a class bloat.
