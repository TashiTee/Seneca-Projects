1) How many elements are there in each C-style character string that stores a family or given name for
account? Why?

- For each C-style string that stores a family or given name for an accout, there are 41 elements.
40 elements are used for the string and 1 element is used for the null terminator at the end of the string.

2) Your class declares two member functions names set (...). In C, this would generate an error. Name
the feature of C++ that allows this.

- The feature is called overloading a function. This feature allows functions to have the same name
with different definitions within the same scope. As long as they have different list of parameters,
it would not generate an error.

3) What have you learned during this workshop?
	
- In this workshop I learned how to access private members of a class, how to modify and gain access
of those private members through public functions, such as set(...) and display() function. I also learned
how to set an empty state for the private members. Learned a little bit about member functions from
ostream and istream.

Quiz 3 Reflection

1. What is the difference between a class and a struct? 
class is set default to private
struct is set default to public
classes are used in C++ but no C
structs are used in both C++ and C

3. What purpose does the const qualifier serve?
- we are defining a member function for student
- const is a query function where there is no change to any of the objects data members
