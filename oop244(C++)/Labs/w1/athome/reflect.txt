1. Namespace is a scope for the entities that it encloses. Scoping rules avoid identifier conflicts across different namespaces
We use namespace to avoid conflicts from having same identifiers for different variables in the application.

2. A header file is generally used to define all of the functions, variables and constants contained in any function library 
for example the  header file stdio.h should be used if you wanted to use the two standard I/O functions printf and scanf. 

3. We don't compile header files because if we compile the header files with two files having #include the compiler is going to fail 
and tell you that there is repetitive declartion. To prevent this problem and each header file is included only once we have to use 
safeguards in our header files.

4. If you #include a cpp file in several other files in your program, the compiler will try to compile the cpp file multiple times, 
and will generate an error as there will be multiple implementations of the same methods.

5. I have learned how namespaces can be used to avoid conflicts from having multiple same identifiers. I now know how headerfiles works
and in order to not compile two files that call one header file we have to use safeguards. We should never include .cpp files  in 
another file so that we don't get compilation errors.
